# cypbd_mapping - Papyrus SysML/MARTE profile definitions for functionality-to-architecture mapping

cypbd_mapping contains SysML-/MARTE-based profiles for the modeling of SW architecture implementations, i.e., the software tasks and messages (local or on the network) that
realize the functions (modeled using concepts from [cypbd_functional](https://github.com/m-morelli/cypbd_functional)) on top of a cyber-physical systems execution architecture (modeled using concepts from [cypbd_architecture](https://github.com/m-morelli/cypbd_architecture)).
